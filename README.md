Problem Statement & Instructions
Read the problem statement, code a working solution (valid input and output will be provided)
and write supporting tests. The solution should be written in one of the following languages:
java, python, golang or scala. Be prepared to explain your solution during a review.
The Problem
We want you to create a production ready, maintainable, testable command-line application that
will calculate the ranking table for a league.
Input/output
The input and output will be text. Either using stdin/stdout or taking filenames on the command
line is fine.
The input contains results of games, one per line. See “Sample input” for details.
The output should be ordered from most to least points, following the format specified in
“Expected output”.
The rules
In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0 points.
If two or more teams have the same number of points, they should have the same rank and be
printed in alphabetical order (as in the tie for 3rd place in the sample data).
